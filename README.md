# Deep Learning Hands-on Notebooks

## What is this?

This repository contains an opinionated suite of hands-on Python notebooks for machine learning and deep learning tasks.

The flow of the modules follow the structure of C. M. Bishop and H. Bishop, _Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts_. Springer Nature, 2023.

## Why?

While mathematical theories provide the foundation for ML/DL, hands-on implementation helps learners:

- Solidify their understanding of abstract concepts
- Develop practical skills for research and industry applications
- Gain intuition about models' behavior

We hence extract the key concepts and provide corresponding practical exercises for each topic.


## How to use?
We expect the reader to first learn corresponding theoretical concept
(whether from the book or other materials)
and then look into the exercises for code implementations.


## Tech stack
While still tentative, we will expect to provide hands-on using Python ecosystem:
- Virtual environments, conda
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework
- Numpy: Mathematical computation
- Pandas: Data analytics library

## Contributing
This is a new tutorial suite and we welcome contributions.
